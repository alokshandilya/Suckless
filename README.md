# My Personal DWM build 🌟

## About dwm 🐧

dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

## Requirements ✏️

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- - `script` will grab dependencies (assuming you run `Arch Linux` or it's derivatives) and make, install suckless utilities. -->
- In order to build dwm you need the _Xlib header files_.
- [***libxft-bgra***](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra-git) for coloured emojis in suckless utilities.
  - comment `iscol` in **drw.c**
